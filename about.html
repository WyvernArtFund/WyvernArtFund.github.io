              <h1>Wyvern Art Fund</h1>
                <p>More and more modern communities that transcend the border of Nation-States are emerging, but at the same time they also face the challenges from a post-colonial geopolitical framework and the conflicts within. Wyvern Foundation calls for artists and philosophers who reflect on the social, cultural, and aesthetic spheres that surround and interact with the global coordination network to join the Wyvern community. Here, we recognize the inefficiency of how we currently coordinate with each other to distribute resources as modern humans, and we refrain from contributing to works that further undermine a healthy solidarity among communities. We provide kindness, openness, acceptance, space, and means of communal curatorial praxis for each other. Together, we present each seasonal exhibition as a collective investigation project in celebration of our co-existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applicants whose project proposal welcomes the idea of “Build Together” while at the same time fits into the investigative direction of each seasonal exhibition will be selected. Our first exhibition, Rite of Spring, is set to happen at the end of April, 2023. Rite of Spring encourages a collective reflection on how participants of the modern society engage with Life as an increasingly digitally intermediated phenomenon by providing financial support for projects that fall into such scope of reflection.

                    A few exemplary proposal areas: digitally intermediated social life, financial transactions without a 3rd trusted party, or changes in everyday soundscape, etc.

                    Wyvern Foundation welcomes artists and philosophers who disclose their inner phenomenon and express them through all kinds of media: such as drawing, painting, music, film, sculpture, writing, etc (please inquire at info@wyv.art if you are not sure whether the preferred medium of your expression is currently supported). What’s more important is the presentation of the project and feasibility to actualize the project proposal. The DEADLINE for the spring season of funding is <strong>20/12/2022</strong>.

                <p> Looking forward to hearing from you! </p>
